                        Blackwell is partially owned by, and financially supported by, the Prescott family. In 1998, they donated the dormitory building to Blackwell.</p>

                        It is clear that the diner is hugely popular, particularly with the students in the area. Police officers, passing truck drivers and other residents of Arcadia Bay also frequent the diner, possibly due to its close proximity to a bus stop, a large parking space next to and opposite the diner and a gas station nearby.</p>

                                       The history of Arcadia Bay's beginnings is relatively obscured. The oldest family that lived in the town is the Prescott Family, who've worked to build or were involved in major aspects of Arcadia's Bay economy and education. Speaking with the fisherman at Two Whales Diner, he confirms that one of Arcadia Bay's primary exports is fishing.
                                    <br><hr><br></p>
                                       <p>However, when the Prescott family gained more influence over the town, they used their finances to limit fishing by gaining rights to the harbor. Their contributions to the town are such that there is legitimate consideration to change the name from "Arcadia Bay" to "Prescott Bay".
